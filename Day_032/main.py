# Day 32 was focused on exploring Python's smtplib & e-mail sending capabilities.
# By the end of the day, this script was created.
# This script is an automated happy birthday e-mail sender.
# It fetches template data from a csv file, using pandas and after making some changes
# to the template, it proceeds to send an e-mail to the e-mails of the contacts who's
# birthday is today.
